This module follows the directions in [1] section, "WildFly Docker image"
to generate an image.

    - created pom.xml.
    * The wildfly-maven-plugin currently does not provide a means to
      pull in the dependency, postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war.
    - Added org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin to pull in
      postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war.  maven-dependency-plugin
      is configured to copy the WAR file into this modules target
      directory.  Lastly this plugin was used to change the name of the WAR
      from postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war to PostOffice.war.

   - Created the Dockerfile from listing in [1].
   - Ran commands
        docker build -t wfly-docker-app .
        docker run -p 8080:8080 wfly-docker-app
   - In a separate terminal window ran commnd.  Expected result returned.
        curl http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/ping
   - Stopped running image.
