Disclaimer, this module was developed May 17, 2023.  It references an article
published Apr 8, 2022.  The referenced plugins and images may have changed
since this usage.


This module follows the directions in [1] section, "WildFly Docker image"
to generate an image.

    - created pom.xml.
    * The wildfly-maven-plugin currently does not provide a means to
      pull in the dependency, postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war.
    - Added org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin to pull in
      postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war.  maven-dependency-plugin
      is configured to copy the WAR file into this modules target
      directory.  Lastly this plugin was used to change the name of the WAR
      from postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war to PostOffice.war.

   - Created the Dockerfile from listing in [1].
   - Ran commands
        docker build -t wfly-docker-app .
        docker run -p 8080:8080 wfly-docker-app
   - In a separate terminal window curl can test the various functions.
        * Check for running service.
            curl http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/ping

        * Upload a file (examples)
            curl  -X PUT -H "attachment: PostOffice.war" -F "attachment=@target/PostOffice.war" http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/upload
            curl  -X PUT -H "attachment: Notes.txt" -F "attachment=@Notes.txt" http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/upload

        * Print list of uploaded files
            curl http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/checkmail

        * Delete uploaded files
            curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/delete/Notes.txt
            curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/delete/PostOffice.war

   - Return to terminal running the docker image and stop the running image.
