Disclaimer, this module was developed May 17, 2023.  It references an article
published Apr 8, 2022.  The referenced plugins and images may have changed
since this usage.


This module follows the directions in [1] section, "WildFly Provisioning Architecture"
using org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin:4.1.0.Final.

    - created pom.xml.
    - added wildfly-maven-plugin from listing in [1].
    * The wildfly-maven-plugin currently does not provide a means to
      pull in the dependency, postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war.
      - Added org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin for that task.
        In addition, this task was defined to run during goal, package,
        the same as wildfly-maven-plugin.  maven-dependency-plugin
        is configured to copy the WAR file into wildfly's standalone/deployments
        directory.  Lastly this plugin was used to change the name of the WAR
        from postoffice-core-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.war to PostOffice.war.
    NOTE: wildfly-maven-plugin supports running wildfly-CLI scripts however
          this may not be sufficient to provide the desired provisioning.
          The user may need to use maven-dependency-plugin, maven-ant-plugin
          or like plugins to provide the desired files to the server and/or
          the final image.

From a developer's perspective having the files to be put into the image on the
local disk can be very helpful in validating and debugging its contents.

   - Created the Dockerfile from listing in [1].
   - Ran commands
        docker build -t wfly-mvn-bld-app .
        docker run -p 8080:8080 wfly-mvn-bld-app
   - In a separate terminal window curl can test the various functions.
        * Check for running service.
            curl http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/ping

        * Upload a file (examples)
            curl  -X PUT -H "attachment: PostOffice.war" -F "attachment=@target/PostOffice.war" http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/upload
            curl  -X PUT -H "attachment: Notes.txt" -F "attachment=@Notes.txt" http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/upload

        * Print list of uploaded files
            curl http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/checkmail

        * Delete uploaded files
            curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/delete/Notes.txt
            curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/cloud/postoffice/delete/PostOffice.war

   - Return to terminal running the docker image and stop the running image.
